# AudioSnapshotServer

*Where do you get the audio data for your visualizer? I pull it out of my ASS.*

TCP/IP server to fetch audio buffer's snapshot from mediaserverd.

## How to use it in your tweak?

If you send anything to localhost at the port 43333 it will reply with current buffer state. That's all to it.
